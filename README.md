# Description of the assignment
Our assignment is the creation of an audio visualiser using Digital Audio Processing in Java. We mapped lines and shapes to the sound waves and frequency of the song Boy's A Liar Pt.2 by PinkPantheress ft. Ice Spice. We used a variety of visuals in order to capture the mood and energy of the song. The core theme of our visuals is the use of a pink and orange, aswell as hearts. The hearts are used to represent the lyrics of the song, which is about loving someone who you know is not dedicated to you. The colours pink and orange symbolise PinkPantheress and Ice Spce, respectfully.

## Instructions
To play out visualiser: Press debug/run, then using the hot keys 1 - 6 you cans switch between different visuals. 
One of our visuals is interactive. 
Pressing key 1 displays out heart-shaped Ships and requires you to use the arrow keys and spacebar, to move and shoot out heart-shaped bullets.


## What I am most proud of in the assignment



# Table of Work
| Student Name | Visual/Code description | How it works |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Zoe Fabre-Anderson | Keybind 2: A 3D cube which spins. Inside is a smaller heart, and text which says the title of the song. | It calculates the average amplitude, lerps it and then maps it to the cube. The cube pulses to the amplitude of the song
| Joanne Umeh | Keybind 1: YASC Heart-shaped ships and bullets | The Yasc java file is a file that a number of red hearts displayed on the screen. These hearts can move clockwise and anti-clockwise. When the space bar is entered the hearts begin to produce mini hearts that can be compared to bullets |
| Joanne Umeh | Seperate terminal window: Confetti EndScreen | The Confetti java file uses a JFrame to produce mini rectangles that fall vertically on the screen. I used a random colour generator to make it look like confetti. I also added sliding text to the file in order for it to resemble a credit page. |
| Shahida Mohammed-Ahmed | Keybind 3: Beating heart with monochrome bars | The heart beats (expands) to the amplitude of the song |
| Shahida Mohammed-Ahmed | Keybind 4: Twerking person (Ice Spice) | The two circles pulsating represent two asscheeks. It is to look like the stick figure is twerking |
| Naomi Togbe | Keybind 5: Terrain and Planet | A noise map to act as a  moving terrain. A planet shape was to be added. The planet pulsed to the amplitude and rotated.|
